// Replacing the value of SRC1 (entirely yellow) with that of SRC2 (which
// is a black->white gradient) results in a black->yellow gradient.  Note
// that high values in the HSV system are not white -- white is obtained
// with high values AND low saturations in HSV, while in HSL (used by
// the replace color operator) a high lightness always produces whites.

let SRC1 := create image from red f(X,Y)=1 green f(X,Y)=1 blue f(X,Y)=0;

apply SRC2 to SRC1 operation replace value
