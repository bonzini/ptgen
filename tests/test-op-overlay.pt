// This operator is quite complex to describe.  In this example overlaying a
// green -> purple gradient (SRC2) over a black->white gradient (SRC1) gives a
// black->dark green->light purple->white gradient.

let SRC1 := create image from red f(X,Y)=X green f(X,Y)=X blue f(X,Y)=X;
let SRC2 := create image from red f(X,Y)=X green f(X,Y)=1-X blue f(X,Y)=X;

apply SRC2 to SRC1 operation overlay
